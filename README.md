# Maze Searching Simulator

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to calculate when adding an additional searcher has no significant impact on the amount of steps it takes to find a person in a maze. Two different types of randomly generated mazes were used. Multiple different type of searching algorithms were also used. Results were gathered in a Monte-Carlo approach.

### Files
The driver function to this program is maze_sim_diff_searcher.m.
All the other files are functions and classes to assist in calculating the optimal number of searchers.
Traversing Randomly Generated Mazes.pdf is a report documenting our procedure, and results.
